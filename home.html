			<h3> This is stuff you should know about me: </h3>
				<h4> Hello may name is Jamy garcia, I am 17. I am a senior at Larchmont Charter high school, and I am also a student athlete as well. My favorite colors are pink and red, but I also have many dislikes. I dislike tomatoes, bananas, onions, and olives. The texture just creeps me out. I enjoy playing the sports I am good at which are soccer, volleyball, and gymnastics. A cool fact about me is that I know how to ice skate adn im a gymnast. I started when I was 6 years old when I was intro- duced to, and now I just Ice Skate for fun but now I just stuck with volleybal, soccer, and gymnastics.
