			<h3> This is stuff you should know about me: </h3>
				<h4> Hello my name is Jamy garcia, I am 17. I am a senior at Larchmont Charter high school, and I am also a student athlete as well.I am bilingual as well, I speak both English and Spanish fluently. Me encanta ser una Latina y ser parte de una differencia en mi mundo. My favorite colors are pink and red.  I also have many dislikes. I dislike tomatoes, bananas, onions, and olives. The texture just creeps me out. I enjoy playing the sports I am good at which are soccer, volleyball, and gymnastics. A cool fact about me is that I know how to ice skate and I am a gymnast as well. I started ice skating and gymnastics when I was 6 years old , and now I just ice skate for fun but for now I just play volleyball, soccer, and gymnastics.
