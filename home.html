			<h3> This is stuff you should know about me: </h3>
			<h4> Hello my name is Jamy Garcia, and I am 17 years old. I am the only child, and I will be the first woman in my family to graduate high school and go to college. It sounds like a lot of pressure but who said life was easy? I have gotten honor roll all my high school years so far and it's a big accomplishment considering the fact that I am a student athlete inside and outside school. I am a senior at Larchmont Charter high school. I enjoy playing the sports I am good at which are soccer, volleyball, and gymnastics. I am aslo bilingual , I speak both English and Spanish fluently. Me encanta ser una Latina, y ser parte de una differencia de y en mi mundo.  A cool fact about me is that I know how to ice skate and I am a gymnast as well. I started ice skating and gymnastics when I was 6 years old , and now I just ice skate for fun but for now I just play volleyball, soccer, and gymnastics.
